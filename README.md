# FreeRTOS-SEP4
Semester project with FreeRTOS. Resource sharing between tasks.

A project I did in the summer 2017. I wish to properly document it to ensure that what I learned during the project will not be lost. Possibly I desire to buy my own equipment, so I can continue working on this project.

The most important aspect of this project was the design decisions for protocols, architecture, task scheduling and ensuring that a real-time system meets its deadlines.
